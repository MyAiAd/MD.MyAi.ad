# Healthcare Newsletter Platform - EHR Integration Guide

Guide for Enterprise tier subscribers on EHR integration.

This guide is for Enterprise tier subscribers who want to integrate the Healthcare Newsletter Platform with their Electronic Health Record (EHR) system.

---

## Overview

Integrating with your EHR system allows you to:
- Automatically sync patient information
- Import health metrics in real-time
- Ensure data consistency across systems
- Save time on manual data entry
- Deliver more timely and relevant newsletters

We support integration with major EHR systems including:
- Epic
- Cerner
- Allscripts
- NextGen
- eClinicalWorks
- athenahealth
- Meditech
- Custom systems via our API

---

## Integration Methods

We offer three methods of integration:

### 1. Direct API Integration

Our RESTful API allows for real-time, bidirectional data exchange.

**Best for:**
- Custom EHR systems
- Organizations with IT development resources
- Scenarios requiring real-time data exchange

[View our API Documentation →](https://api.healthcarenewsletter.com/docs)

### 2. FHIR Integration

We support the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for healthcare data exchange.

**Best for:**
- Modern EHR systems supporting FHIR
- Integration with multiple healthcare data sources
- Meeting interoperability requirements

[View our FHIR Implementation Guide →](https://api.healthcarenewsletter.com/fhir)

### 3. Batch File Import

Automated import of patient data and health metrics via secure file transfer.

**Best for:**
- Legacy EHR systems
- Scheduled data updates (not real-time)
- Minimal IT resource requirements

## Data Mapping

The following table outlines how data maps between typical EHR fields and our platform:

| EHR Field       | Platform Field   | Notes                                     |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Patient ID      | External ID      | We maintain this for reference            |
| First Name      | first_name       | Required                                  |
| Last Name       | last_name        | Required                                  |
| Email           | email            | Required                                  |
| Date of Birth   | date_of_birth    | Optional                                  |
| Problem List    | health_conditions| Mapped to our standardized list           |
| Medications     | medications      | Mapped to our standardized list           |
| Allergies       | dietary_restrictions | Partial mapping (food allergies only) |
| Lab Results     | health_outcomes  | Mapped by result type                     |
| Appointment Date| next_appointment | Most recent future appointment            |

## Implementation Process

### 1. Initial Setup (1-2 weeks)

- Complete the integration request form
- Sign additional data security agreements
- Schedule kickoff call with our integration team
- Determine integration method and data mapping
- Establish connectivity between systems

### 2. Configuration (1-3 weeks)

- Set up authentication credentials
- Configure data mapping rules
- Establish data transformation logic
- Set synchronization frequency
- Configure error handling and notifications

### 3. Testing (2-4 weeks)

- Test with sample data
- Validate data mapping and transformations
- Verify security and privacy controls
- Perform load testing
- Validate error handling

### 4. Go-Live (1 week)

- Final security review
- Production credentials issued
- Initial data sync
- Monitored rollout
- Knowledge transfer to your team

### 5. Ongoing Support

- 24/7 monitoring of integration points
- Regular sync status reports
- Quarterly integration health checks
- Updates for EHR version changes

---

## Security and Compliance

Our EHR integration maintains stringent security standards:

- All data transfers are encrypted using TLS 1.3
- Authentication via OAuth 2.0 or API keys
- IP whitelisting for added security
- Audit logs of all data exchanges
- HIPAA-compliant data handling
- BAA amendment for integration
- Data minimization (we only sync what's needed)
- Regular penetration testing of integration points

---

## Sample Integration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Daily Patient Sync

- Every night at 2 AM, your EHR exports new and updated patient information
- Files are transferred to our secure SFTP server
- Our system processes the files, updating patient records
- Changes are available in the platform by 6 AM
- You receive a daily sync report via email

### Scenario 2: Real-time Health Metrics

- Patient completes a lab test (e.g., A1C)
- Results are entered into your EHR
- Via API, the new result is immediately sent to our platform
- The result is recorded as a health outcome
- If the patient is due for a newsletter, the new information is included

### Scenario 3: Bi-directional Engagement Data

- You send a newsletter campaign via our platform
- Patient engagement data (opens, clicks) is collected
- This data is sent back to your EHR via FHIR
- Providers can see newsletter engagement in the EHR
- Care coordinators can follow up with non-engaged patients
