## Newsletter Templates

### Creating Templates

Templates are reusable newsletter designs that can be used for multiple campaigns.

To create a new template:

1. From the dashboard, click "Newsletters" in the navigation menu
2. Click the "Create Template" button
3. Enter a name for your template (e.g., "Diabetes Monthly Update")
4. Enter a default subject line
5. Begin designing your template by adding content blocks
6. Click "Save Template" when finished

Templates can be edited, duplicated, or archived as needed.

### Adding Content Blocks

Templates are built using a block-based editor. To add content:

1. While editing a template, click "Add Content Block"
2. Choose from available block types:
   - **Text**: For paragraphs, lists, and headings
   - **Image**: For adding photos, diagrams, or illustrations
   - **Button**: For calls-to-action or links
   - **Divider**: For visual separation between sections
   - **Spacer**: For adding vertical space
   - **Health Info**: Specialized blocks for health condition information
3. Configure the block settings
4. Add personalization tags if needed (see Personalizing Content)
5. Set display rules if the block should only appear for certain patients

Blocks can be rearranged by dragging and dropping, duplicated, or deleted as needed.

### Targeting Specific Patient Groups

Templates can be targeted to specific patient groups based on their health profile:

1. In the template settings, go to the "Targeting" section
2. Select any combination of:
   - **Health Conditions**: e.g., diabetes, hypertension
   - **Medications**: e.g., metformin, lisinopril
   - **Dietary Restrictions**: e.g., gluten-free, low-sodium
3. Save your targeting settings

When a campaign uses this template, it will only be sent to patients who match at least one of the specified criteria. If no targeting is set, the newsletter will be sent to all patients with active consent.

Within a template, individual content blocks can also have their own targeting rules, allowing for highly personalized content.

### Personalizing Content

Use personalization tags to dynamically insert patient-specific information:

1. While editing text, click the "Personalization" dropdown
2. Select from available tags:
   - Basic: `{first_name}`, `{last_name}`, `{full_name}`
   - Health: `{health_conditions}`, `{medications}`
   - Date: `{current_date}`, `{current_month}`, `{current_year}`
   - Appointments: `{next_appointment}`

Tags will be replaced with the actual patient information when the newsletter is sent.

### Preview and Testing

Before using a template in a campaign:

1. Click the "Preview" tab to see how your template looks
2. Use the "Test Patient" dropdown to preview personalization for specific patients
3. Click "Send Test Email" to send a test to yourself or a colleague
