# Healthcare Newsletter Platform - Temporary Deployment

This README explains the current state of deployment.

## Current Status

The application is currently using a temporary Express server for deployment while we resolve some dependency issues with Prisma and Next.js. The placeholder server displays a simplified version of the homepage.

## Development Plan

1. ✅ Set up temporary Express server deployment
2. ⬜ Configure Prisma correctly with schema file
3. ⬜ Fix Next.js build configuration
4. ⬜ Deploy full application

## For Developers

If you're working on this project locally, use the standard Next.js development setup:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run in development mode
yarn dev
```

The temporary deployment is just for the production environment while we resolve build issues.
